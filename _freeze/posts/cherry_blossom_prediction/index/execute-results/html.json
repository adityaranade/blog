In the recent past, cherry blossom season marks the arrival of spring season which can be considered as a transition from winter to summer. People try to make plans travel to enjoy this phenomenon. So how about using some simple statistical techniques to try and forecast / predict the peak cherry blossom time ?\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: justify\"}\nAlong with some of my fellow PhD classmates, I participated in the International Cherry Blossom Prediction Competition hosted by George Mason university. We explored a lot of models and I am going to show a very basic model which I tried during the early stages. The model is the Autogegressive (AR) model. The notation of the simplest AR model, namely AR(1) model is as follows\n:::\n\n$$\nY_{t} = \\beta_{1} Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta_{i}$ is the model parameter and $\\epsilon_{t}$ is the white noise\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: justify\"}\nThis means the value of random variable Y at time t depends on the value of the same variable at time (t-1). If you are aware of the simple linear regression, think of this as the explanatory variable being the same as the predictor variable in rough sense. In the competition, we tried to predict the bloom date for multiple location across the world based on the data available provide by the university. However, for the purpose of this post, I will show the analysis only for one location, Kyoto in Japan.\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: justify\"}\nLet us start with first reading in the dataset and loading the R packages required for the analysis\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(forecast)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'forecast' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'quantmod':\n  method            from\n  as.zoo.data.frame zoo \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(fpp2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'fpp2' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────────────── fpp2 2.5 ──\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n✔ fma       2.5     ✔ expsmooth 2.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'fma' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'expsmooth' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(vars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'vars' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: MASS\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'MASS' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:fma':\n\n    cement, housing, petrol\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: strucchange\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'strucchange' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: zoo\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'zoo'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.Date, as.Date.numeric\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: sandwich\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'sandwich' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: urca\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'urca' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: lmtest\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'lmtest' was built under R version 4.3.2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the dataset\nkyoto <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMU-CherryBlossomCompetition/peak-bloom-prediction/main/data/kyoto.csv\",header=T)\n\nggplot(kyoto,aes(x=year,y=bloom_doy))+geom_point()+theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/load packages-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
