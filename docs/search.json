    "text": "Indian Premier League (IPL) is an annual cricket league which is played under the T20 format. It was started in the year 2008 and has quickly gained popularity among cricket playing nations and has probably become one of the biggest sporting event in the Indian sports calendar.\nThe tournament is played between various teams based out of different cities in India. IPL is currently in its 14th season where the tournament has been played with 8 teams from 2008 - 2010 and 2014-2021. It was played with 10 teams in 2011 and 9 teams in 2012 and 2013. From 2022, it has been expanded again to 10 teams.\nThe tournament followed a double round-robin format from 2008 - 2021 (except for the year 2011) where each team plays the other team twice (once at each team’s ‘home’ ground). From the year 2022, the teams are divided into two groups and every team plays 14 games (twice against the teams in the same group, twice against one team from other group and once against the other teams from the other group). At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs. For the first 3 years (2008-2010), the traditional semifinals and final approach was considered. From 2011, a playoff structure was introduced to award the top two teams with an additional chance to reach the finals. This ensured the competition stays relevant till the last game of the league stage as teams vie for top 2 position. The figure below explains the playoff structure.\n\n\n\nIPL Playoff Structure\n\n\nThe top two teams of the league stage have two chances to reach the final. The thought behind this playoff structure was that the top two teams should not be out of the tournament due to one bad day in the semi-finals.\nA question that pops up in the mind is “Does the best team win the tournament”. In other words, does the team which finishes the league stage at the top of the table have the best chance to win the league. The team which finishes the league stage position 1 has won the most number of points (and in case of tied points, has a superior net run rate) and hence is considered the “best” team in the league. We would be tempted to say yes. But let’s find out what the data says.\nWe have the data available for 11 years (2011 - 2021) for the league stage standings and the playoff results for the team topping the league stage from IPL official website which can be seen below\n\n\n\nTeam finishing first during league stage\n\n\nWe can observe, the team which tops the league stage has won the tournament only three 3 of 11 times which corresponds to approximately 27.27%. However, this is just the observation from 11 years so cannot be considered as the best indicator of probability. We will consider a Bayesian statistical model to calculate the probability of the team finishing the tournament as winner, runners up and third place.\nIn simple terms, a Bayesian model is reconciliation of our belief ( ‘prior’ distribution) with the observed data (likelihood) to give the updated belief (‘posterior’ distribution). Here the information (prior, likelihood and posterior) is in the form of mathematical distribution functions.\nIf we consider the random variable ‘result’ which indicates the position of the team at the end of the tournament. The team which finishes the league stage at the top of the table can finish at any position from 1 to 3 at the end of the tournament where 1 stands for winner, 2 stands for runner’s up and 3 stands for 3rd place. Since the variable can take only 1 out of the 3 values, it follows a categorical distribution which is denoted as result ~ categorical(\\(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}\\)) where \\(p_{1}\\), \\(p_{2}\\) and \\(p_{3}\\) indicates the probability of finishing at each of the position at the end of the tournament.\nWe will consider the probabilities as a random variable as well. We have to assign a distribution to the variable in such a way that our beliefs are reflected in the distribution. We will consider the team has an equal chance at finishing at each of the positions. This ensured by assigning a Dirichlet(1,1,1) distribution to (\\(p_{1}\\), \\(p_{2}\\), \\(p_{3}\\))\nSo the model is as follows\n\\[result \\overset{\\mathrm{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} Categorical(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}) \\]\n\\[(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}) \\sim Dirichlet(\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{3}) \\]\nWe run this model on 11 years of the data available (2011 - 2021) and we get the credible interval for the posterior probabilities of finishing at each of the position\n\n\n\nCredible intervals for probabilities for team finishing first during league stage\n\n\nThe horizontal line indicates the plausible values for the probability of team finishing in a particular position and black point indicates the estimated value of the probability from the available data and model used.\nWe can see the probability of being runner up is higher than the probability of finishing as winner or 3rd place which seem to have almost the same probability. This means the team finishing at the top of the table at the end of the league will more often go on to lose in the playoffs (finish as runner up or \\(3^{rd}\\) place) at the end of the tournament.\nIsn’t it surprising? It surely is. Let us look at some of the reasons this might be the case. More often than not, the team which finishes at the top of the table during the league stage accumulates most of the points during the early stages and tends to lose steam towards the business end of the tournament. It might be a case of peaking too early. There might be some other psychological impact that might be worthwhile to study.\nSo probably the best team in the league (team finishing first during league stage) does not win the tournament.!\nLet us perform the same analysis for the team which finishes at second position in the league stage. We will use the same model used for the team finishing first at the league stage. Using data from 11 years, we get the following plot\n\n\n\nCredible intervals for probabilities for team finishing second during league stage\n\n\nWe can see the probability of being winner is higher than the probability of finishing as runner’s up or 3rd place. This means the team finishing second in the league stage will more often go on to win the tournament. Surely a surprising result!"

    "text": "Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman are usually dubbed the faboulous four of Indian cricket team. In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, these players were at their peak and were the backbone of Indian Test Cricket team from the batting perspective.\nWe will have a look at the career batting average of each of the player against the nine test playing nations and try to understand which of the player has been a consistent performer across teams. Sachin Tendulkar made his test cricket debut in 1989 whereas Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman made their debuts in the year 1996. Sourav Ganguly was the first to retire in 2008 followed by Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman both of whom retired in the year 2012 and lastly Sachin Tendulkar retired in the year 2013.\nThe career summary of the four players under consideration can be seen in table below\n\n\n\nCareer details for players\n\n\nSince all the players have played more that 100 matches (and more that 150 innings), we can compare the batting averages for them against all the nine test playing nations. However, we will get a little adventurous and use a Bayesian approach to calculate the credible intervals for the batting average for each of the player.\nIn case you are wondering what a Bayesian method means, it is simply reconciling our belief (prior) with the data (likelihood) to obtain updated belief (posterior). And the credible interval gives us the plausible values for the batting average based on the data we have. Along with the average against each opponent, we are incorporating the variation in the scoring as well which is nothing but considering how consistently or inconsistently the runs were scored.\nWe will incorporate another layer of uncertainty in the sense that we let the parameter at the first level have their own uncertainty and assign a distribution of their own. This is done through a Bayesian hierarchical model\nThe Bayesian Hierarchical model we will use for each player is as follows\n\\[Y_{i} \\overset{\\mathrm{i.i.d}}\\sim N(\\mu_{opposition[i]}, \\sigma_{opposition[i]}^2)\\]\n\\[\\mu_{opposition} \\overset{ind}{\\sim} N(\\theta,\\tau^2)\\]\n\\[\\theta \\sim N(\\theta_{0}, \\tau_{0}^2)\\]\n\\[\\tau \\sim Ca^{+}(0,1)\\]\n\\[\\sigma_{opposition} \\sim Uniform(10,200)\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_{0} = 50\\) and \\(\\tau_{0} = 10\\) has been used which is consistent with each of the player’s career average.\nThe model was run using a JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) which samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters. We will not go into much details about the individual parameters but use the parameters to come up with the credible intervals for the average runs scored per innings for all the players against each of the test playing nation. We than combine the credible intervals for all the players into a single plot which can be found below.\n\n\n\n\nCredible intervals for the average runs scored per inning against each of the opposition\n\n\nWe have the credible intervals for each of the four players against the nine test playing nations. Opposition is indicated on the x axis and the horizontal lines corresponding to any of the opposition is the credible interval for average against that particular opposition. We use different colors to indicate which player the interval corresponds to. Purple colour corresponds to intervals for Sachin Tendulkar, red colour corresponds to intervals for Rahul Dravid, green colour corresponds to intervals for Sourav Ganguly and blue colour corresponds to intervals for VVS Laxman.\nSince all the players have played against each of the opposition, we have intervals for all the players against all the opposition. However, all the players have batted less than 10 innings against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe and hence the intervals are not much meaningful.\nThere are two characteristics which can be understood looking at any of the interval. The first is the width of interval which indicates how consistent the player was against that particular opposition. If the width of the interval is big, that indicates the player scored runs inconsistently against the particular opposition. So we ideally want the interval to be as narrow as possible.\nThe second characteristic is the location of the interval which indicates the average of the player againt a particular opposition. If the average is higher, the location of the inteval will be towards the right and if the average is on the lower side the interval will lie towards the left side. Ideally we want a interval to be towards the right side.\nNow that we have understood how to read the intervals, let us start comparing the intervals for players against each of the opposition. In professional sports, every player seems to have a ‘favored’ opposition against whom the player plays extraordinarily well which will be indicated in the plot by a narrow interval towards the right side. Similarly every player has an opposition who they do not enjoy playing which will be indicated in the plot by a wide interval and/or interval towards the left side.\nAgainst SENA countries\nFor teams in the Indian subcontinent, test cricket against SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia) are considered an good indicator of how good a player is.\nAustralia was the most dominant opposition during the playing career of the four players. Australia tour of India in 2001 was a legendary series which was the turning point of Indian test cricket. The second test match in the series at Kolkata which India won while following on (an overwhelmingly difficult task) was nothing short of a legendary match. It is well know that Australia is VVS Laxman’s favoured opposition. However, if we look at the interval’s corresponding to Australia, we can see that Sachin Tendulkar has a better average than the other three players against Australia followed by VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid and lastly Sourav Ganguly.\nAgainst New Zealand, Rahul Dravid seems to have the higher average followed by VVS Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and lastly Sourav Ganguly.\nAgainst England, Rahul Dravid seems to have the higher average followed by Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and lastly VVS Laxman. VVS Laxman seems to have unusually low interval for average against England.\nAll the players seem to have performed below par against South Africa. Among the four players, Sachin Tendulkar seems to have performed relatively better than then the other three players who seems to have a similar record against South Africa.\nAgainst other countries\nAgainst Pakistan, Rahul Dravid has the highest average followed by Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and lastly VVS Laxman.\nAgainst Sri Lanka, Sachin Tendulkar has the highest average followed by Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and lastly VVS Laxman.\nAgainst West Indies, Rahul Dravid has the highest average followed by Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman and lastly Sourav Ganguly. Sourav Ganguly has an unusually low interval for average against West Indies.\nAll the players have played less than 10 innings against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh and hence the scores have more variation in them which can be seen by the wide intervals. So comparing the intervals for the players against these two teams is not meaningful."
